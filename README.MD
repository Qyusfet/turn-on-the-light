# Project Instruction!!!
*The aim of this project is to practice the basic I've learned so far in Javascript. I used internal Javascript.*

*I use the Javascript document model to target the two buttons and make them turn on and turn of the bulb when clicked.*

1. I create internal script tag `<script type="text/javascript"></script>`
2. I give button 1 `id` of `myBtn1`
3. I use JavaScript `document` to target `myBtn1` id and store in a const variable called `btn1`
4. I give the second button id of `myBtn2`
5. I use JavaScript `document` to target `myBtn2` id and store in a const variable called `btn2`
6. I add event listener to each of the buttons and replace the image `src` attribute.
